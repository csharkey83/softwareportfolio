		<h2>A Little Background</h2>

            <p> 
			For the purpose of showcasing my versatility, I have decided to include a real-life project that I created for my employer.  I created a Microsoft Excel form/document
			that includes VBA coding.  Before I get to explaining the form and how it works, I wanted to mention that I have never taken any advanced Excel courses, nor did anyone help
			me with this project.  I created this 'smart' document using what I learned from my software development classes and a little Microsoft language research.  
			</p>
			
			<p>
			One thing I have learned, is that when it comes to programming/coding, anything is possible as long as you are 
			willing to code it. After learning and gaining a better undestanding of the basics of programming/coding languages and syntaxes, 
			I decided to take on the task of designing and creating this project.
			</p>
			<p>
			This project was created in an effort to address some issues we were having in our department. The department I work for is the Operating Room at Truman Medical Center West.
			I will first start by explaining how the process use to work, before the implementation of this electronic surgery alert/reservation form I created,
			so as you can have a better understanding of how this project truly impacted the process.  Then I will point out issues with the process and how it impacted the OR (operating room) on the day of surgery. 
			</p>
			<p>
			Once it was determined that a patient seen in clinic needed surgery, the following process took place: 
			<ol>
				<li>Staff doctor or resident would partially fill out the paper alert form</li>
				<li>They would walk it over to their nurse clinician</li>
				<li>The nurse clinician would then fill out the remaining information such as:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Diagnosis Code</li>
						<li>Procedure to be performed (information given to her by doctor/resident)</li></li>
						<li>Diagnosis code(s)</li
						<li>Rest of the patient information (such as date of birth, medical record number, phone number ...)</li>
						<li>CPT 4 code</li>
						<li>Pre-Anesthesia and post-op visit information</li>
					</ul>
				<li>The nurse clinician would then have to walk over to fax machine and fax document to 'right fax' number and wait for the confirmation</li>
				<li>The nurse would have to save a copy to archive</li>
			    <li>Finally, the nurse clinician would have to either make a copy of the alert and walk or fax it to the utilization specialist (finance department) to get prior authorization for surgery</li>
			</ol>
			The alert, once faxed, would come to a special email address designated to 'right fax' from which we, the OR schedules, would be able to print and then schedule the case.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			Some of the issues with this process are pretty obvious.  Mainly how inefficient it truly was.  However, there were several issues that greatly impacted us in the OR as well.
			The biggest issues were:
			<ul>
				<li>Since alerts were hand written, they were hard to read and therefore causing issues scheduling case correctly</li>
				<li>When cases were scheduled incorrectly, on the day of surgery, it was causing delays</li>
				<li>These delays greatly impacted the OR utilization and patient satisfaction</li>			
			</ul>
			</p>
			
			<p>
			With the implementation of the electronic alert form, the new process is:
			<li>Staff doctor or resident will fill out most of the paper alert form (as now they are accountable for what is on it)</li>
				<li>They can now email the form to their nurse clinician (in the excel format)</li>
				<li>The nurse clinician will fill out the remaining information such as:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Diagnosis Code</li>
						<li>Pre-Anesthesia and post-op visit information</li>
					</ul>
				<li>The nurse clinician will then click the "Submit To OR" button to send it to the OR email, utilization specialists, and pre-anesthesia nurses</li>
			</ol>
			As you can see it did not drastically change the process, but it did streamline it because now:
			<ul>
				<li>The doctors/residents can send the alert to their nurse from where they are in the hospital (as they can download from the intranet)</li>
				<li>This in turn generates a copy of what they sent to the nurse in their sent fold and in the nurses </li>
				<li>The nurses can now get the alert no matter where they are at and fill out the rest of the information</li>
				<li>The nurses no longer has to look for a fax machine as they can send to the OR and utilization specialists directly from their desks (generating an electronic copy easier to archive)</li>
			</ul>
			For us in the OR it also dramatically impacted not only our utilization, but our ability to schedule cases.  Now:
			<ul>
				<li>The alert forms are easy to read.</li>
				<li>There are no issues selecting the correct preference card(s), as the doctor/resident have already indicated which one they want</li>
				<li>Thus, reducing case delays for not having the correct equipment while increasing patient satisfaction</li>
			</ul>			
			</p>
			
       <h2>Project Description</h2>
        	

			<p>
			The following are key features of the form that have made it be so successful:
			<ul>
				<li>Forces all text to all caps (makes it easier to read)</li>
				<li>Since not all the doctors perform the same procedures (i.e. Orthopedics, General Surgery), some fields are dependent on each other.  For example:</li>
				<ul>
					<li>'Preference Card' field is dependent on the 'Primary Surgeon' field</li>
					<li>'CPT 4' field is dependent on the 'Preference Card' field (as it generates the CPT 4 code for the procedure, unless code depends on specific location or doctor requested not to have CPT code generate)</li>
					<li>2nd 'Encounter Type' field depends on 1st 'Encounter Type' field (2nd Encounter Type field is only available if 'AM Admit' is selected in field 1</li>
				</ul>
				<li>Date field automatically updates the drop down list dates (today - 6 months out)</li>
				<li>The completed/submitted time on the bottom of the alert is timestamped with the current system date and time (and auto updates as you complete the alert)</li>
				<li>Once the submit button is clicked:</li>
					<ul>
					<li>Form checks to make sure that all required fields filled in, if not it will show an alert indicating which field is missing.</li>
					<li>Form checks to make sure Outlook app is open</li>
					<li>If no errors are detected, it will create a PDF copy of the form, open the PDF for nurse to view.</li>
					<li>Then generate a Outlook message with everyone who needs the alert form in the To and CC fields, and attach the PDF form to the email to be sent</li>
					</ul>
				<li>Once form is submitted to the OR, the OR email will automatically respond with a confirmation email indicating that alert has been received</li>
			</ul>
			Note: The reason the form is converted to PDF is to avoid it from being altered by anyone else once the form is submitted.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			You are more than welcome to fill out the form to test it and click the "send to me" button as I have made modifications for the purpose of this portfolio and it will
			only send it to my email address.  I also encourage you to try to leave some required fields (the ones with *) to see the alert and also to try to send it without Outlook 
			open to see the message it generates.  All fields that are that have a light blue border have a drop-down list or you can free text and all fields with an orange border
			you can only select from the drop-down list.  Some boxes also have a message/comment to assist in filling out the form.
